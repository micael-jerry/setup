This repository contains my **personal automation script** for setting up a development environment on Ubuntu.  
I use it whenever I reinstall or switch systems to quickly restore my preferred configuration and workflow.  

## ✨ Features

- Installs and sets up tools I personally use  
- Adds environment variables and shell customizations  
- Supports multiple shell configuration files  
- Safe to re-run without creating duplicate configurations  

## 📂 Structure

- **`install.sh`** – the main script with my setup instructions  
- **`.tmp/`** – temporary files used during installation  

## 🛠 Usage

1. Clone this repository:

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/micael-jerry/setup.git
  cd setup
